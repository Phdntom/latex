\begin{problem}{1} Pressure / Pascal's Law\\
Scientists have found evidence that Mars may have once had an ocean $0.50km$ deep. The acceleration due to gravity on Mars is $3.71 m/s^2$.
\item a) What would be the gauge pressure at the bottom of such an ocean, assuming it was freshwater? [A: $1.86 \times 10^6 Pa$]
\item b) To what depth would you need to go in earth's ocean to experience the same gauge pressure? [A: $184m$]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2} Buoyancy / Archimedes' Law\\
A slab of ice floats on a freshwater lake. What minimum volume must the slab have for a 60kg human to be able to stand on it without getting their feet wet? [A: $7.45 m^3$]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3} Fluid Flow / Continuity Equation\\
A shower head has 20 circular openings, each with a radius $1mm$. The shower head is connected to a pipe with radius $0.80cm$. If the speed of the water in the pipe is $3.0m/s$, what is its speed as it exits the shower-head openings? [A: $9.6m/s$]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4} Energy / Bernoulli's Equation\\
What gauge pressure is required in the city water mains for a stream from a fire hose connected to the mains to reach a vertical height of $15.0m$? [A: $1.47\times 10^5 Pa$]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{5} Bernoulli + Continuity\\
A golf course sprinkler system discharges water from a horizontal pipe at the rate of $7200 cm^3/s$. At one point in the pipe, where the radius is $4.0cm$, the water's absolute pressure is $2.4\times 10^5 Pa$. At a second point, the water passes through a constriction with radius $2.0cm$. What is the absolute pressure as the water flows through the constriction? [A: $2.25\times 10^5 Pa$]
\end{problem}
