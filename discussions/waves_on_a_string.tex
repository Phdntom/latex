 \title{Discussion - Waves on a String}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{problem}{1}
A traveling wave on a string is described at $t=0$ by $y(x, 0) = (0.05m) \frac{1}{1+x^2}$, distances in meters, time in seconds.
\item (a) Sketch this wave at $t=0$.
\item (b) Find any inflection points and explain physically what is happening to the wave at these points.
\item (c) What does the wave equation say the acceleration of the string (the medium) should be at these points?
\item (d) At what $x$ would you expect the transverse speed of the string to be a minimum? and maximum?
\item (e) The wave propagates in the $+x$ direction at speed $3m/s$. Write $y(x, t)$.
\item (f) Calculate the string's transverse velocity, $v_y$, as a function of time.
\item (g) At what value of x is $v_y$ zero? Does this make sense?
\item (h) At what value of x is $v_y$ a maximum?
